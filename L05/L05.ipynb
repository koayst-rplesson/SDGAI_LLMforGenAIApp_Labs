    "Prompt Engineering has been a hot topic ever since ChatGPT from OpenAI was released to public in November 2022.  Coupled with the rapid development of Generative AI, it is driving learners to skill up their competence in this area. I am sure when you google for \"prompt engineering courses\", there are a lot out there. One tutorial stands out from the rest is `Anthropic's Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial`. It is free and hands-on learning that teaches you to shape and refine your interaction with `Claude`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Prompt evaluation is an essential skill for anyone working with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude. Here's why it's important:\n",
    "- `Maximizing AI Performance`: Effective prompt evaluation identifies whether the prompt elicits the desired type of response, whether that's detailed, concise, creative, or specific.\n",
    "- `Improving Model Understanding`: Evaluating prompts allows users to better understand the model's strengths, limitations, and how it interprets instructions. This knowledge can then be used to craft prompts that play to the model's strengths.\n",
    "- `Supporting Iterative Improvement`: Prompt evaluation is a cyclical process where each iteration helps refine both the prompt and the modelâ€™s use. This ensures continuous improvement over time."
